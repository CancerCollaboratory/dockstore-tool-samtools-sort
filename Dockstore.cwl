baseCommand: [samtools, sort]
doc: |
  Sort alignments by leftmost coordinates, or by read name when -n is used. An appropriate @HD-SO sort order header tag will be added or an existing one updated if necessary.

  Usage: samtools sort [-l level] [-m maxMem] [-o out.bam] [-O format] [-n] -T out.prefix [-@ threads] [in.bam]

  Options:
  -l INT
  Set the desired compression level for the final output file, ranging from 0 (uncompressed) or 1 (fastest but minimal compression) to 9 (best compression but slowest to write), similarly to gzip(1)'s compression level setting.

  If -l is not used, the default compression level will apply.

  -m INT
  Approximately the maximum required memory per thread, specified either in bytes or with a K, M, or G suffix. [768 MiB]

  -n
  Sort by read names (i.e., the QNAME field) rather than by chromosomal coordinates.

  -o FILE
  Write the final sorted output to FILE, rather than to standard output.

  -O FORMAT
  Write the final output as sam, bam, or cram.

  By default, samtools tries to select a format based on the -o filename extension; if output is to standard output or no format can be deduced, -O must be used.

  -T PREFIX
  Write temporary files to PREFIX.nnnn.bam. This option is required.

  -@ INT
  Set number of sorting and compression threads. By default, operation is single-threaded
